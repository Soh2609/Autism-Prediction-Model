##autism_prediction_model.ipynb:
Contains the entire workflow for the autism prediction model, including:
Data preprocessing
Model selection and evaluation
Final prediction implementation

##best_model.pkl:
The serialized version of the trained machine learning model that was selected as the best-performing model.
ACCURACY SCORE: 86% , but due large insufficiency in training attributes might differ with custom data.

##encoders.pkl:
Pickle file containing label encoders used for preprocessing categorical data, ensuring consistent encoding during predictions.

LICENSE:
Specifies the licensing terms for using, modifying, or distributing the project.

README.md:
